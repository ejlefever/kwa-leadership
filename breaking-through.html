								<h2>The Framework</h2>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>This series of workshops and coaching is built upon the framework described in the groundbreaking book Breaking Through: the Making of Minority Executives in Corporate America by David A. Thomas, Dean of Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.   Based on six years of extensive research, Professor Thomas identified the critical success factors in the career development of both minority and majority group members.   These include a focus on competence and learning, developing a reputation for integrity and business impact, building a track record of high consequence successes, broadening your experience base, and developing mentors, sponsors and a broad range of relationships.   He identifies three additional challenges faced by minorities in organizations with little minority representation in senior management, and explores the impact of these challenges on individuals' career paths.  These challenges include the prevalence of prejudice and stereotyping, greater difficulty building developmental relationships, and organizational difficulty identifying high-potential minorities.</p>

                <h3>The Managers Program</h3>
                <p>Breaking Through: The Managers Program is designed to help the leaders of your organization understand the unique challenges facing minorities within your organization, the critical role managers play in the work experience of minority employees, and what they can do to create an environment which allows minority employees to contribute fully.   The workshop covers career development challenges facing minorities in the workplace, the existence of hidden bias, and strategies to help create an environment of true inclusion and opportunity for all. This program may also incorporate additional assessment instruments and coaching.</p>

                <h2>The Career Development Program</h2>
                <p>We have created Breaking Through seminars lasting 1-2 hours, and we have created comprehensive multi-component Breaking Through programs for high potential people of color and women delivered over a 6-month to 1-year period.  Depending on the length of the program and the objectives of the organization, these programs may include individual coaching, assessments, videotaping, customized exercises, and presentations by senior leaders in the organization. Programs often culminate in the development of a personal Breaking Through Action Plan by each participant. </p>

								<p>Depending on your companyâ€™s objectives, the audience for this program can be comprised of majority and minority group employees, cross-sections of minority groups, or individual minority groups.</p>
