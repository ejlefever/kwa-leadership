                <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                <p>We believe there is an art to coaching.  With the overall mission of helping our clients achieve their goals, we utilize every tool we possess - our coaching skills, business experience, knowledge base, and sometimes even our contacts.  We listen, question, challenge, share and offer information and different perspectives to help our clients learn, grow, move into action, and achieve results.</p>

                <h3>Breaking Through Coaching</h3>
                <p>We are often called upon to coach women and people of color.  We understand the underlying cultural values which may impact behaviors, as well as the unique challenges faced by women and people of color.  By combining our understanding of these cultural factors, our expertise in leadership and diversity, and our coaching model, we help women and people of color step up and contribute fully as leaders within their organizations.  (See Breaking Through for more information)</p>

                <h2>Coaching for Results</h2>
                <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                <p>In Coaching for Results, we work with individuals to help achieve organizational objectives.  The coaching mandate may come from the Board of Directors, the Chief Operating Officer, a Human Resources professional, a manager, or the individual.  Organizational objectives often include helping an individual become a more effective leader or individual contributor, develop the skills necessary to take on a higher position, or make a successful transition to a new position.</p>

                <p>We first meet with the appropriate people at the organization to gather information, identify focus areas, and define what a successful outcome would look like from the organization’s perspective.  We then meet with the individual to discuss the coaching process, identify potential development areas, and define the desired result of the coaching from both the organization’s perspective and his/her perspective.  We gather data from various sources which might include performance reviews, assessments, and interviews of managers, peers and direct reports.  Based on this background information, we work with the individual to deepen his/her understanding of the issues and help him/her to move into action in a thoughtful, constructive, and targeted way.  The goal is to achieve the organization’s and individual’s desired outcomes in a long-term and sustainable manner.</p>

                <h2>Coaching to Reinforce Learning</h2>
                <p>Coaching to Reinforce Learning increases the impact of a learning initiative.  Participants often leave a well-designed and executed training program energized and ready to move into action.  All too frequently, their motivation wanes as they return to the reality and rigors of their daily work environment.</p>

                <p>Coaching to Reinforce Learning supports participants by providing a structure for reflection, action, and accountability.  With their coach, participants reflect on the program material, the possibilities and application of its use, the obstacles to implementation, and the unique challenges and issues the individual is facing.  With a deeper understanding of the issues, the individual and coach formulate a plan of action.  The individual leaves each coaching session with a list of specific action items, a time frame for each action, and the knowledge that he/she must report back to the coach at their next session.  Through Coaching to Reinforce Learning, training program participants are provided with a support structure designed to deepen their understanding of the issues and make sustainable change.</p>
